<h3>Patient Guardian Name First</h3>

<div class="dottedbox">
	<p>The first name of the guardian.</p>
	<p>The patient guardian is the next-of-kin or associated party that
		has been identified by the DQA as the "guardian". For the purposes of
		data quality this term is loosely applied and includes the under-age
		patient's mother, father or other responsible part. IIS typically do
		not strictly identify or track the parental or guardian status of
		next-of-kin, instead the "guardian" information is used to identify a
		point-of-person for contact about the patient (such as immunization
		reminders) or to add one more point of reference for matching patient
		records. The DQA reflects this practice by identifying for each
		patient one reported Next-of-Kin as the patient's guardian. Normally
		this is the first Next-of-Kin sent in the message, or the first one
		identified as Mother, Father or Guardian.</p>
