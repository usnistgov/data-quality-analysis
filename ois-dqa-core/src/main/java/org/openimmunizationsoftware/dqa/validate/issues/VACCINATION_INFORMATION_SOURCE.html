<h3>Vaccination Information Source</h3>

<div class="dottedbox">
<p>Indicates if the vaccination was administered or is being
	reported from an historical source. This field is used to distinguish
	between vaccinations that were given to a patient from those that are
	known to have been given because of second-hand information.</p>
<h4>Administered Vaccinations</h4>
<p>Any vaccine that was administered by the submitting organization,
	at any time, are considered administered. The submitter is reporting
	the information as first-hand information and is expected to have
	detailed knowledge of the vaccination event. An administered
	vaccination can be used to decrement lot inventory in an IIS.</p>
<h4>Historical Vaccinations</h4>
<p>Any vaccination history information that the submitter received,
	such as information from a paper shot record or medical record, are
	considered historical. Typically a submitting system will provide a
	separate user interface to enter this information in. This information
	is important to build a complete vaccination history of the patient but
	the submitter is not expected to have more than basic information about
	the vaccination. In addition, this vaccination will not be decremented
	from lot inventory. Many vaccinations issues only apply to administered
	vaccinations and do not apply for historical.</p>
