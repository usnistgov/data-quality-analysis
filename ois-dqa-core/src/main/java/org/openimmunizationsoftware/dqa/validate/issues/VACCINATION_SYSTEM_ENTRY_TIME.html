<h3>Vaccination System Entry Time</h3>

<div class="dottedbox">
	<p>The date and time that this vaccination was reported to have
		been entered into the submitting system. This information is optional
		in HL7 and reported from the submitting system. The value may be used
		for troubleshooting purposes or to help indicate if a vaccination is
		administered or historical. (Historical vaccinations are not normally
		entered soon after they have been given.)</p>
