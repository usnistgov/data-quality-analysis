<h3>Next of Kin Relationship</h3>

<div class="dottedbox">
	<p>The relationship from the patient to the Next-of-Kin. For
		children, a next-of-kin can be used to represent the child's parent or
		guardian. Finding the parent or guardian for a child-aged patient is
		critical for proper identification of children and for determining the
		point-of-contact for immunization out reach activities.</p>
	<p>The first step that the DQA takes when reading the Next-of-Kin
		is to determine if the patient is under-age or not. The under-age
		threshold is determined by IIS policy but is generally 18 years old.
		If the patient is under-age the following checks will be made:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Is the Next-of-Kin relationship one of the unexpected values?
			For children the DQA does not expect the sender to identify a Child,
			Foster-Child, or Step-Child relationship. If these values are being
			sent the DQA suspects that the sending system is using this field in
			reverse of the standard and identifying the relationship from the
			Next-of-Kin to the patient. If the Next-of-Kin is the patient's
			parent, then Child is the incorrect relationship.</li>
		<li>Is the Next-of-Kin relationship a value that is recognized as
			someone who could potentially to be a responsible party for the
			patient's care? Possible values include: Mother, Care Giver, Father,
			Grandparent, Parent, or Guardian.</li>
		<li>If the relationship is some other value, such as Brother or
			Sister, it is ignored.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Later in the process one responsible party will be selected as
		the first Next-of-Kin with a qualifying responsible party
		relationship.</p>
