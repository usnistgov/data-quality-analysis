<h3>Patient Submitter Id</h3>

<div class="dottedbox">
	<p>The id of the patient assigned by the submitter. This is also
		known as the Medical Record Number (MRN), Patient Id, and Chart
		Number. This id is critical to help match patients submitted by the
		same submitter. Sending systems must ensure the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Every patient is submitted with an id.</li>
		<li>A patient is assigned a unique id that has never been used to
			identify a different patient from this same submitter.</li>
		<li>The id represents the best id for the patient and the sending
			systems best attempt to provide a final consolidated patient id.</li>
	</ul>
</div>
