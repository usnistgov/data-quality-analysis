<h3>Vaccination Placer Order Number</h3>

<div class="dottedbox">
	<p>The vaccination order number as assigned by the "placer". This
		field was originally designed for systems that sent messages (not
		necessarily vaccination related) in order to negotiate the ordering of
		medications for administration. The use of this field is not well
		standardized for immunization purposes.</p>
