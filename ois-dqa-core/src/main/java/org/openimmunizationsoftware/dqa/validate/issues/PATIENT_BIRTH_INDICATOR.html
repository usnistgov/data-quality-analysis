<h3>Patient Birth Indicator</h3>

<div class="dottedbox">
	<p>Indicates if patient is part of a multiple birth (i.e. twin or
		triplet.) This information is critical to IIS to help patient matching
		algorithms recognize that two similar patients are actually twins and
		not referring to the same patient. This field should only be valued if
		the patient was determined to be or not be a part of a multiple birth.
		Do no send N as a default.</p>
