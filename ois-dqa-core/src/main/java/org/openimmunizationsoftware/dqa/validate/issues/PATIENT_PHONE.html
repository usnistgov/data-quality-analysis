<h3>Patient Phone</h3>

<div class="dottedbox">
	<p>The primary phone for the patient or the patient's
		parent/guardian.</p>
	<p>
		The DQA validates phone numbers for those using the <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Numbering_Plan">North
			American Numbering Plan</a>. All other phone numbers, such as
		international phone numbers, are not currently validated. The
		following basic checks are made if the phone number is not empty:

	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If area code is specified then must be 3 digits long and the
			first digit may not be a 1 or 0.</li>
		<li>The local number must contain exactly 7 numeric digits. Other
			non-digit characters are ignored.</li>
		<li>The 1st local number digit can not be a 1 or a 0.</li>
		<li>The 2nd and 3rd local number can not be both 1. (For example:
			411 and 511 are not valid exchange numbers.)</li>
	</ul>
