<h3>Vaccination Admin Code</h3>

<div class="dottedbox">
	<p>The vaccination code, either CVX or CPT, that was submitted to
		indicate the vaccination given. If an issue is registered under a CVX
		code, these will "bubble" up to these set of issues. For example, if
		the CVX code is unrecognized, both 'Vaccination CVX code is
		unrecognized" and 'Vaccination admin code is unrecognized' will be
		triggered. The generic 'Vaccination admin' to catch issues that may
		appear on either CVX or CPT codes, depending on which is submitted.</p>
</div>
