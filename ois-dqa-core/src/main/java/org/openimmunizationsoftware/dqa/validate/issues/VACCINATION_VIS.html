<h3>Vaccination VIS</h3>

<div class="dottedbox">
	<p>The eligibility that the patient was determined to have for the
		vaccination indicated. Federal and state vaccine projects, such as
		Vaccines For Children (VFC), pay for and distribute vaccines that may
		be given to patients meeting certain criteria. The Vaccination
		Financial Eligibility Code indicates the status the patient was
		determined to have in consideration of the administered vaccination.
		Often a patient status applies to all vaccinations given and in the
		past this information was reported at the patient level. But there are
		situations where the funding status only applies to some vaccines and
		not others. For this reason this information should now be reported at
		the vaccination level.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Important Note:</b> Issues associated with this field are only
		triggered if the vaccination is indicates has having been
		administered. Historical vaccinations are not expected to be reported
		with this information.
