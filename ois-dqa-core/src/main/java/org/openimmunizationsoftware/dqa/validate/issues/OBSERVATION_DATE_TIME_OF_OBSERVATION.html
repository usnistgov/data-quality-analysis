<h3>Observation Date Time of Observation</h3>

<div class="dottedbox">
	<p>The date and time when the observation was collected. This is
		the time most relevant to the patient, and should be closest to when
		the question was asked. The time recorded is okay as well, as long it
		is roughly equivalent.</p>
