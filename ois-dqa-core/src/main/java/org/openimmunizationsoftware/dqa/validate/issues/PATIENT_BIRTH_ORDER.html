<h3>Patient Birth Order</h3>

<div class="dottedbox">
	<p>For patients that are part of a multiple birth this is used to
		indicate which position the baby was born in. (For example: 1st twin
		or 2nd twin.) This information is critical to help IIS distinguish and
		match twins and triplets that might otherwise be confused as the same
		patient. If this field is given a value then the patient birth
		indicator field should also be valued. It is okay, but not necessary
		to indicate 1 for single births. This field should only be valued if
		the information is specifically known. It is not appropriate to
		indicate 1 for all patients as a default. If the information is not
		known, leave the field blank.</p>
