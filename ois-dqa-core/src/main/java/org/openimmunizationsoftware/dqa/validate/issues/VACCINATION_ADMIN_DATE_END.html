<h3>Vaccination Admin Date End</h3>

<div class="dottedbox">
	<p>Originally used to indicate the ending time for medications that
		were given by IV across a certain period time. This information is not
		pertinent to vaccinations and in the past, because it was required,
		was to repeat the value sent as the vaccination administration date.
		At this point the field is optional and it is recommended that no
		value be sent. Otherwise, if a value is sent it should match the
		vacciantion administration date and should not be used to indicate any
		other information such as system entry date.</p>
</div>
