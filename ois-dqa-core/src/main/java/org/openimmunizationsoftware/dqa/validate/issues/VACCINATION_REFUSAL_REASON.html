<h3>Vaccination Refusal Reason</h3>

<div class="dottedbox">
	<p>The reason given for why the vaccination was refused and not
		administered. All administered and historical vaccinations that were
		actually given should not send any value in this field. If a value is
		sent here then this indicates that the patient did not receive this
		vaccination because it was refused. In this case the value for
		Vaccination Completion should also indicate that the vaccination was
		not given because of the refusal. This field gives the specific reason
		why a vaccination was refused. The refusal reason is only considered
		missing when the completion status is indicated as refused.</p>
