<h3>Patient Protection Indicator</h3>

<div class="dottedbox">
	<p>Indicates whether the patient information should be protected
		and NOT included in an IIS. A positive answer to this field indicates
		that the patient specifically requested that the patient should not be
		included in the IIS. A negative answer indicates that the patient
		specifically requested that the record be included in IIS. It is
		important to not put default values in this field reflecting submitter
		policy, IIS practice or state law.</p>
	<p>For example if a state law requires that all patient's
		specifically consent to be included in the registry this field should
		not be valued as Y for NOT CONSENTED unless the patient specifically
		declined. In this case a blank value indicates that this information
		should not be included in the IIS.</p>
