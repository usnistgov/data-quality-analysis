is\ incomplete=Value has part of the information but not all that was expected or required.  
is\ inconsistent=Value is inconsistent with another related field.
is\ invalid=Value has been designated as invalid because of the values format or because it is not one of the accepted values. To resolve, format the value according to HL7 rules or choose a valid value.

This issue does not apply to historical vaccinations where the exact vaccination used may not be known. 
is\ not\ vaccine=Vaccination code indicates an item that is actually not a vaccination.

is\ unexpected=The value is not normally expected to be sent in this situation, and signals a possible data quality issue.
