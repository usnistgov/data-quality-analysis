<h3>Patient Birth Date</h3>

<div class="dottedbox">
	<p>The date the patient was born. This does not normally include
		the time, which if sent is normally ignored. The date is the local
		date of where the patient was born and the official date that is
		placed on the birth certificate. This information is used for patient
		matching and determining when vaccinations are due.</p>
