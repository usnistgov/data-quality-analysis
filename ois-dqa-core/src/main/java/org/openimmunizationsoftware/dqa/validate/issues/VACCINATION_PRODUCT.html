<h3>Vaccination Product</h3>

<div class="dottedbox">
	<p>A virtual concept, derived from the vaccination admin code and
		the vaccination manufacturer. The vaccine CVX/CPT code and the vaccine
		manufacturer, together, identify a specific vaccine product that was
		administered. If a vaccination product is not recognized, this
		indicates that the manufacturer and the vaccine CVX/CPT were not
		recognized as a valid combination. In this case the solution is to
		ensure that the correct CVX/CPT or MVX is being used. It is important
		to remember:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>CVX codes are preferred over CPT. If both are sent, CVX is
			normally used and the CPT ignored.</li>
		<li>The date of the vaccination affects which combinations are
			considered valid. (Vaccine Products are only valid around and
			including the dates they were manufacturered by a particular
			manufacturer.)</li>
		<li>Vaccine products are deprecated when they are known to be
			valid values but have been administered earlier or later than when
			known to be manufactured. This may happen during transitions from one
			manufacturer code to another (such as when one manufacturer merges
			with another.) Please keep manufacturer codes up-to-date.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Vaccine products are currently <a
			href="http://www2a.cdc.gov/vaccines/iis/iisstandards/vaccines.asp?rpt=tradename">defined
			by the CDC</a>.

		<b>Important Note:</b> Issues associated with this field are only
		triggered if the vaccination is indicates has having been
		administered. Historical vaccinations are not expected to be reported
		with this information.
