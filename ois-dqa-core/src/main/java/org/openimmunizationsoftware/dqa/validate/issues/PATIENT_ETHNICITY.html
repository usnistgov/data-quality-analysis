<h3>Patient Ethnicity</h3>

<div class="dottedbox">
	<p>In the past ethnicity codes were indicated as part of race. This
		concept has now been refined and is now reported in two fields: race
		&amp; ethnicity. This information is used for aggregated reporting on
		coverage levels for different groups of patients.</p>
