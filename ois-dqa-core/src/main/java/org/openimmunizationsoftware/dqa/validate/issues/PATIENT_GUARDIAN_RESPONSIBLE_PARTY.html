<h3>Patient Guardian Responsible Party</h3>

<div class="dottedbox">
	<p>The patient guardian is the next-of-kin or associated party that
		has been identified by the DQA as the "guardian". For the purposes of
		data quality this term is loosely applied and includes the under-age
		patient's mother, father or other responsible part. IIS typically do
		not strictly identify or track the parental or guardian status of
		next-of-kin, instead the "guardian" information is used to identify a
		point-of-person for contact about the patient (such as immunization
		reminders) or to add one more point of reference for matching patient
		records. The DQA reflects this practice by identifying for each
		patient one reported Next-of-Kin as the patient's guardian. Normally
		this is the first Next-of-Kin sent in the message, or the first one
		identified as Mother, Father or Guardian.</p>
	<p>If the patient guardian responsible party is missing, this
		indicates that the patient was under-age (minor) and that no
		Next-of-Kin was found that could be used as the responsible party.</p>
	<h4>Resolution</h4>
	<p>The name of the responsible person should be sent in the first
		Next-of-Kin and identified as the Mother, Father or Guardian. The
		value of Guardian is generic indicates Father, Mother, or Responsible
		Person. Use Guardian if the person is known to fill some responsible
		role in the patient's care (such as presenting with the patient or
		primarily responsible for payment of care.)</p>
